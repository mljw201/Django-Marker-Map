note: the page will run on http://127.0.0.1:8000/markers/map/

# Customisation

the scale to which the map is zoomed in, along with where it is centred upon (if location unknown / denied) can be changed in lines 6/7 of the map.js file (located in map/markers/static/map.js)

to add markers to the map, create a superuser before running the server:

```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

and then go to the admin page where you can add and delete markers
